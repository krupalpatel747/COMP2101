#
# this script displays some host identification information for a Linux machine
#
# Sample output:
#   Hostname      : zubu
#   LAN Address   : 192.168.2.2
#   LAN Name      : net2-linux
#   External IP   : 1.2.3.4
#   External Name : some.name.from.our.isp

# the LAN info in this script uses a hardcoded interface name of "eno1"
#    - change eno1 to whatever interface you have and want to gather info about in order to test the script

# TASK 1: Accept options on the command line for verbose mode and an interface name
#         If the user includes the option -v on the command line, set the varaible $verbose to contain the string "yes"
#            e.g. network-config-expanded.sh -v
#         If the user includes one and only one string on the command line without any option letter in front of it, only show information for that interface
#            e.g. network-config-expanded.sh ens34
#         Your script must allow the user to specify both verbose mode and an interface name if they want
# TASK 2: Dynamically identify the list of interface names for the computer running the script, and use a for loop to generate the report for every interface except loopback
